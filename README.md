This study will look at the distribution of Humpback whales in the Southern ocean between 2020-2023. I will focus on the months November to March as this is when Humpback whales migrate south to feed. The data were obtained from GBIF.org (https://www.gbif.org/dataset/a1d3149a-899c-431b-b8f0-16df4eaaaa40) and is an accumulation of human observations of Humpback whale sightings.
